# Anime info website using React + Vite

This is my mid-term react project for my bootcamp , I will be using a api: https://jikan.moe/ to fetch the data that i need , the user will be able to login and will be able to see a list of popular anime series and movies, search anime and add them to a favorite list. 
this is only the begging of the project as time goas on i will be add more things to it.
